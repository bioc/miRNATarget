 \title{Conversion table between RefSeq and illumina_mousewg_6_v1 for mouse}
 \description{
 This gene id conversion table between RefSeq and illumina_mousewg_6_v1 is for MiRaGE package, based upon BioMart Gene ID Converter}
 \details{The first column includes RefSeq gene id and the second column includes corresponding illumina_mousewg_6_v1. It can be made out of getBM function in biomaRt package.
Please note that the name of object loaded is not "MM_refseq_to_illumina_mousewg_6_v1" but "id_conv", because of the requirements by MiRaGE package.}
\note{
For more details on how to generate this table, please see functions in MiRaGE package and vignette.}
