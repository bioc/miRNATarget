 \title{Conversion table between RefSeq and affy_hg_u95a for human}
 \description{
 This gene id conversion table between RefSeq and affy_hg_u95a is for MiRaGE package, based upon BioMart Gene ID Converter}
 \details{The first column includes RefSeq gene id and the second column includes corresponding affy_hg_u95a. It can be made out of getBM function in biomaRt package.
Please note that the name of object loaded is not "HS_refseq_to_affy_hg_u95a" but "id_conv", because of the requirements by MiRaGE package.}
\note{
For more details on how to generate this table, please see functions in MiRaGE package and vignette.}
